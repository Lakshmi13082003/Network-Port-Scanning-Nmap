Task 1: Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports

Tools Used

Nmap (TCP SYN Scan)

Wireshark (Packet Analysis)

Kali Linux

Step 1: Identify Local IP Address

Command used:

ifconfig


Result:

IP Address: 192.168.1.226
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Network Range: 192.168.1.0/24

Step 2: Perform TCP SYN Scan

Command used:

nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24


Scan Result Summary:

Total IPs scanned: 256

Hosts up: 5

Scan type: TCP SYN (Stealth Scan)

Step 3: Open Ports Discovered
Host: 192.168.1.1

21/tcp – FTP

53/tcp – DNS

80/tcp – HTTP

443/tcp – HTTPS

Host: 192.168.1.3

8008/tcp – HTTP (Alt)

8009/tcp – AJP13

8443/tcp – HTTPS-Alt

9000/tcp – cslistener

9080/tcp – glrpc

Host: 192.168.1.5

135/tcp – MSRPC

139/tcp – NetBIOS

445/tcp – SMB

Total Open Ports Identified

21, 53, 80, 443, 8008, 8009, 8443, 9000, 9080, 135, 139, 445

Step 4: Service & Risk Analysis
1. Port 21 – FTP

Risk:

Sends credentials in plain text

Can be captured using Wireshark

Anonymous login possible

Vulnerable to brute-force attacks

2. Port 53 – DNS

Risk:

DNS spoofing

Cache poisoning

DNS amplification attacks

Information leakage

3. Port 80 – HTTP

Risk:

No encryption

Data visible in packet capture

SQL Injection

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Session hijacking

4. Port 443 – HTTPS

Risk:

Weak SSL/TLS configuration

Expired certificates

Vulnerable backend web application

5. Port 8008 – Alternate HTTP

Risk:

Often misconfigured

Internal application exposure

Weak authentication

6. Port 8009 – AJP13 (High Risk)

Risk:

Vulnerable to Ghostcat (CVE-2020-1938)

File read vulnerability

Sensitive data exposure

7. Port 8443 – HTTPS-Alt

Risk:

Weak encryption

Misconfigured SSL

Vulnerable web apps

8. Port 9000 – cslistener

Risk:

Custom application port

Possible admin service

Potential malware C2 communication

9. Port 9080 – glrpc

Risk:

Middleware exposure

Authentication bypass

Possible remote code execution

10. Port 135 – MSRPC (High Risk)

Risk:

Windows RPC service

Remote exploitation possibility

Used in lateral movement attacks

11. Port 139 – NetBIOS (High Risk)

Risk:

File sharing exposure

User enumeration

Information disclosure

Brute force attacks

12. Port 445 – SMB (Very High Risk)

Risk:

EternalBlue exploit

WannaCry ransomware

Remote code execution

Unauthorized file system access

This port should never be exposed to the internet.

Step 5: Wireshark Analysis

Wireshark was used to monitor network traffic during the Nmap scan.

Observations:

TCP SYN packets sent to multiple hosts

SYN-ACK responses from open ports

RST packets from closed ports

Clear-text HTTP traffic visible

FTP communication can be captured in plain text

Wireshark complements Nmap by:

Showing packet-level communication

Verifying open port responses

Identifying unencrypted traffic

Detecting suspicious behavior
